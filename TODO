-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New structure

* Ressource management
  - make flexible path support
  - make texture ressource management
  - make models ressource management
  - make sound ressource management

* Menu system
  - Make menuitem color
  - Make the menu system smarter, wrt the way it uses variables from the
    gamestate
  - Render nice background image?
  - Make provisions for setting stuff about the players, like colors, etc.

* Design
  - all references from display to the current map, should go through the 
    current game. Or should they? What about the display lists?
  - check that we are on track wrt a dedicated server.
  - what about "going into orbit" type of events?
  - make all types of entities capable of damaging eachoter?
  - should the display have the role of the client class, with respect to the
    rendering of menus?

* Bugs
  - visual bugs sometimes - underside drawn? Related to texturing or culling?
    This bug may have gone away with the map now using floats for heights.
    May be related to the resolution of the depth buffer. Test with moving near
    plane farther away.
    The conflicts with glu objects seem to be resolved with moving the 
    clipplane away. However, the problems with textures may persist.
  - it seems projectiles that leaves the map explode in the wrong height.
    This may be related to the Within method, that I have changed sligthly.
    (This may even be fixed).
  - there are some color issues when rendering lines with lighting
  - checkout if the ostrstream.str operator has memory leaking problems (the
    way it is used, that is).
  - A vertical projectile sometimes never seem to hit anything!!!!
  - explosions take place below the surface? Or is it only when they hit _exactly_
    at the corner of a triangle?
  - The top 4 lines seems to have a wrong color?
  - The tanks are rather "dusty" - the lighting is probably fucked
  - There are quite a bit of dead code.
  - TMap::LowerAll does not take into account explosions that take place in the
    air??? Or?
  - Can we get stuck without beeing able to change turns?

* Research
  - 3d collision detection
  - in-front-of/behind issues with planes (viewpoint) etc.
  - LOD

* Gameplay/state
  - seperate gamestate from "client" side?
  - help button - at least describe keys.
  - config/variable/alias/console system
  - team support
  - computer players
  - simultanous mode
  - different tanks?
  - direct hit should take out a tank
  - support for moving the tank around

* Map and Physics
  - make nice map slide stuff/max steepness, wear out when distance to "changereason" 
    increases
  - better colision detection with tanks - projectiles should be checked against 
    tanks as well as the ground
  - separate physics engine from code? How?
  - use bounding boxes for collision detection with tanks?
  - support more map sizes
  - slide on a map should be optional, as well as the max steepness.

* Landscape
  - load landscape from file? (Nah)

* Display/rendering
  - find better textures
  - blend textures when height changes. What does tuxracer do?
  - better heigth related texturing
  - model for missiles
  - model for tanks
  - shot animation (smoke?)
  - nicer impact animation (smoke?)
  - LOD on landscape/only render stuff in front of viewer
  - mipmapped textures (does this make a visible difference)
  - change between different "stored" viewpoints.
  - make nice dynamic HUD for multiple players.
  - animate landscape slide/tanks falling?
  - is it faster to minimize texture binds, or does it not matter when glList?
  - experiment with field of view
  - what about the textures, and more dynamic maps?
  - world map sphere rendering?
  - make real console
  - support for storing a number of viewpoints for each player
  - burned ground texture where hits have happened
  - some kind of background picture

* Entities to be implemented
  - landmines, that explodes when hit
  - smoke trail from missiles
  - smoke from damaged tanks
  - napalm
  - rolling bombs
  - more projectiles
  - burning areas of the map
  - trees, stones, bushes
  - lakes???

* Sound
  - use OpenAL for sound
  - how to get sound into the design at present
  - missile fligth sound
  - landscape slide sound
  - damping on distance
  - display sound for in game menu
  - better sounds! (Really needed)

* Control and configuration
  - console
  - controle
  - configuration files

* Mouse
  - control orientation with mouse
  - grab mouse in fullscreen mode

* Network
  - network support
