----------------------------------------------------------------------
* REQUIREMENTS

This program has only been tested under Linux. You need support for OpenGL
(Mesa3D) and probably some sort of hardware support to run this program.

My development machine is a PPro 232 Mhz, 128 MB ram, with two V2 3dfx cards.
I get about 40 fps on medium maps on this machine, which is good enough.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* COMPILING

To compile:
$cd src && make && cd ..

You may have to fix some includes and stuff, especially for
<GL/*>. Some compilers seems to be more strict about implict type
conversions than others.

You will get several warnings. Most should be safe to ignore for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* RUNNING

To run:
$./thx

If you get a coredump, there are 3 very likely causes: 
- you do not have rigths to access your 3d hardware. 
 (You may be running as non-root/with restrictive permissions).
- you are running as root, but have not setup your display correctly.
- you found a bug! (Please report this)

If you have OSS sound, there should be some sound effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* GOTCHAS

The program does not grab the mouse - make sure that you do not move
the mouse outside the window you start the program in, or you may
loose control.

If you get a full screen window, that does not react to your input, 
you may be stuck with the mouse outside the window. Also, if another
application grabs global focus, you may no longer be able to control
thx. (This happens for me, when I use my 3dfx card, and my mail box
pops a message up. In this case, I blind switch to a virtual console,
log in, and run "killall thx", which solves my problems).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* CONTROLS DURING GAME

(Subject to change, please check inputconsumer.cc)
