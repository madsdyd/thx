This is the README for "Tank Hill eXtreme".

This program has only been tested under Linux. You need support for OpenGL 
(MesaGL) and probably some sort of hardware support to run this program.

To compile:
$cd src && make && cd ..

To run:
$./thx

If you get a coredump, there are 3 likely causes: 
- you do not have rigths to access your 3d hardware. 
 (You may be running as non-root/with restrictive permissions).
- you are running as root, but have not setup your display correctly.
- you found a bug! (Please report this)

The program does not grab the mouse - make sure that you do not move the mouse
outside the window you start the program in, or you may loose control.

Controls for controlling the menu: Please use the help option in the menu.
