AUTOTOOLS TEMP TODO:
- Should the documents be installed somehow? How about a man page?

- Check that all the options for configure actually works as
  expected.

- make dist don't work on mother?!?

NORMAL TODO:

Version schedule. 

This is an overview of what features go where. This is subject to change.

- FIX: Rotation can loop, when speed is to high to be caught. Need to fix,
  probably by figuring out the shortest distance to target, and use that.

- The AI players need to 
  - figure out feedback
  - buy weapons

The text () is the focus of the "series". E.g. 0.4.0 (AI) means that
everything starting with 0.4. is probably going to be related to AI. The 0.4.0 release
however, is the final release of the previous series.

- Consider; Making a TWorld, that contains the world; Wind, Terrain, Entities, etc?
  Should probably be done, postpone to CVS access. For now, I put it into the map.
  The game logic and such is still in TGame.

- Consider splitting the menuitems into a larger number of files
  (Add TColorMenuItem for starters)

- Make skjalm fix the wind code.

- Should money have interest?

** 0.4.0 (AI)
  - Implement wind before going AI. (Sort of done)
  - Console
  - Make a ceiling?
  - Implement AI entities
  - Connect to event pipelines

** 0.4.8 (Postponed menu and controls stuff)
  - mouse bindings to axis
  - make global variables to adjust the axis on the mouse

** 0.4.9 (Postponed clean up)
  - Clean up dependencies between the different state variables
    especially the menu stuff and TGame stuff.
  - Remove dead code.
  - Fix the public interface in a lot of classes.
  - a lot of files depends on vector.hh!
  - make copy constructors explicit.

** 0.5.0 (Ressource management)
  - make flexible path support
  - make texture ressource management
  - make models ressource management
  - make sound ressource management

** 0.6.0 (Models)
  - On disk model format
  - Loader
  - Renderer
  - model for missiles
  - model for tanks
  - Make sure that "heavy" code uses display lists or similar

** 0.7.0 (Map)
  - Change format to allow for LOD, culling, etc.
  - Use fog?
  - make nice map slide stuff/max steepness, wear out when distance to "changereason" 
    increases
  - support more map sizes
  - slide on a map should be optional, as well as the max steepness.
  - load landscape from file - with spawnpoints for tanks(?)
  - LOD on landscape/only render stuff in front of viewer
  - Check up on CPU usage during normals recalculation/hole making.

** 0.8.0 (Physics and gameplay)
  - Look below for ideas and problems
  - simultanous mode
  - different tanks?
  - direct hit should take out a tank
  - support for moving the tank around
  - better colision detection with tanks - projectiles should be checked against 
    tanks as well as the ground
  - separate physics engine from code? How?
  - use bounding boxes for collision detection with tanks?
  - landmines, that explodes when hit
  - smoke trail from missiles
  - smoke from damaged tanks
  - napalm
  - rolling bombs
  - more projectiles
  - burning areas of the map
  - trees, stones, bushes
  - lakes???

** 0.8.5 (Customization)
  - make real console
  - support for storing a number of viewpoints for each player
  - config/variable/alias/console system that is global for the game.
    Maybe each entity should know its game?
  - console
  - controles
  - configuration files

** 0.9.0 (Sound)
  - lots of sound names are wrong and confusing
  - use OpenAL for sound
  - how to get sound into the design at present
  - missile fligth sound
  - landscape slide sound
  - damping on distance
  - display sound for in game menu
  - better sounds! (Really needed)

** 0.9.5 (Graphics)
  - Add a score screen, bound to tab?
  - Make a radar display
  - Nice rendering of scoll up and down menuitems
  - find better textures
  - blend textures when height changes. What does tuxracer do?
  - better heigth related texturing
  - shot animation (smoke?)
  - nicer impact animation (smoke?)
  - mipmapped textures (does this make a visible difference)
  - change between different "stored" viewpoints.
  - make nice dynamic HUD for multiple players.
  - animate landscape slide/tanks falling?
  - is it faster to minimize texture binds, or does it not matter when glList?
  - experiment with field of view
  - what about the textures - should they be mapped by steepnees, instead of height.
  - world map sphere rendering? Skybox? Some kind of background picture
  - burned ground texture where hits have happened

** 1.0.0 (User interface)
  - Title screen
  - Intro?
  - Demo mode
  - rpm and deb files?
  - Publicity, freshmeat, linux games site, etc.
  - Look below

** Post 1.0
  - Improved graphics, eyecandy, etc. 
  - Improved sounds
  - Network

** Postponed
  - Write some documentation
  - move data to consistent structure
  - implement destructors
  - tighten includes
  - memory check code
  - tidy code
  - Make the init order more explicit (needed now?)
  
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Menu system
  - Make a menuitem that issues a command
  - Make the menu system smarter, wrt the way it uses variables from the
    gamestate
  - Render nice background image?

* Design
  - all references from display to the current map, should go through the 
    current game. Or should they? What about the display lists?
  - check that we are on track wrt a dedicated server.
  - what about "going into orbit" type of events?
  - make all types of entities capable of damaging eachoter?
  - should the display have the role of the client class, with respect to the
    rendering of menus?

* Bugs (Note, some of these may be fixed)
  - Is the grabbing of the mouse broken in windows? (Yes on fast pc's)
  - The mouse "jitters" when used for movements, etc. Something is wrong.
  - Sometimes, someone can not register a command. This may have something
    to do with the order the global objects are being created in. 
    Need to fix this - Singleton pattern?
  - visual bugs sometimes - underside drawn? Related to texturing or culling?
    This bug may have gone away with the map now using floats for heights.
    May be related to the resolution of the depth buffer. Test with moving near
    plane farther away.
    The conflicts with glu objects seem to be resolved with moving the 
    clipplane away. However, the problems with textures may persist.
    Need to do collision checking with the viewpoint, keeping it "near" 
    away from everything.
  - it seems projectiles that leaves the map explode in the wrong height.
    This may be related to the Within method, that I have changed sligthly.
    (This may even be fixed).
  - there are some color issues when rendering lines with lighting
  - checkout if the ostrstream.str operator has memory leaking problems (the
    way it is used, that is).
  - A vertical projectile sometimes never seem to hit anything!!!!
  - explosions take place below the surface? Or is it only when they hit _exactly_
    at the corner of a triangle?
  - The top 4 lines seems to have a wrong color?
  - The tanks are rather "dusty" - the lighting is probably fucked
  - There are quite a bit of dead code.
  - TMap::LowerAll does not take into account explosions that take place in the
    air??? Or?
  - Can we get stuck without beeing able to change turns?
  - Tons of memory leaks

* Research
  - 3d collision detection
  - in-front-of/behind issues with planes (viewpoint) etc.
  - LOD

* Gameplay/state
  - seperate gamestate from "client" side?

* Clean up code
  - encapsulate stuff in viewpoint(?)

* Network
  - network support
