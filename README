2014-08-18: Imported from SourceForge. May get around to fix this at
some point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* REQUIREMENTS

This program has only been tested under Linux. You need support for OpenGL
(Mesa3D) and probably some sort of hardware support to run this program.
Also, a sound card for effects (and a screen of some sort for display, and
so on ;-). You need GLUT version 3.7 installed.

My development machine is a PPro 232 Mhz, 128 MB ram, with two V2 3dfx cards.
I get about 40 fps on medium maps on this machine, which is enough for me,
but probably will not allow me to implement fancy graphics.

There are several performance enhancement to be implemented in the
game.  Eventually this should improve the performance and visual
look of the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* COMPILING

THX uses the GNU autotools, and configuration and installation should
be a piece of cake.

* BOOTSTRAPPING

If you have checked out the sources from cvs, you should run the shell 
script "bootstrap", which will create the script "configure" for you.
For reasons not understood, it may be neccesary to run this script
twice to get the necessary files created.

* CONFIGURATION

If you have downloaded a tar ball, the configure script should already
be in place. Run "./configure --help" to get an overview of the options.

* INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT

Due to the quite silly way THX currently uses its data, you either need
to install THX, or use the --datadir option to spcify an absolute path
to the "data" directory. The easiest is to install THX. If you are not
comfortable with installing into the system, or do not have root access, 
you can configure THX to install to another directory, with the --prefix
option, like this:

./configure --prefix=/usr/tmp/thx-test

Then, you can make and install, using

make install

You can later uninstall thx with

make uninstall

Please note, that if you find out that you want to permanently install THX,
you should do a 
make distclean && ./configure && make install

In its default configuration, THX will install to /usr/local/bin/thx,
and the data files will go to /usr/local/share/games/thx/

Eventually the silly install requirement will go.

Since I have yet to test THX across a wide range of system, y
ou will probably get some warnings. Most should be safe to ignore for
now. You should be able to compile without problems on RedHat 7.0, 
Mandrake 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. If you have problems, please let me
know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* RUNNING

To run
$/path/to/thx

If you get a core dump, there are 3 very likely causes: 
- you do not have rights to access your 3d hardware. 
 (You may be running as non-root/with restrictive permissions).
- you are running as root, but have not setup your display correctly.
- you found a bug! (Please report this)

If you have OSS sound, there should be some sound effects. THX will
complain at startup, if it can not open /dev/dsp, and you will hear no
sound.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* CONTROLS DURING GAME

The below describes the default bindings. Please use the Controls menu
to change (most of) these in the game. If you wish for THX to store your
bindings between games, please crate a directory called .thx in your
home directory, like this
mkdir $HOME/.thx
THX will then store your bindings in a file called mappings.cfg. 

Please edit inputconsumer.cc (and recompile), if you wish to change
the default bindings. This will also be necessary if you wish to
change the bindings for the mouse movement.

If you change the bindings in the game, please note that if you bind
e.g. "move forward" to "r" and "quit immediate" to "r", "move forward"
will have precedence. The effect will be, that "r" will not quit while
playing the game, but will quit if pressed while viewing a menu,
result screen or similar.

For key bindings please note that 'a' is different from 'A' - and so
on.

Default keys:

* Menus 
use the usual keys or the mouse to navigate the menus. Use the arrow
keys to change values.

* General
quit thx          : q    (at almost any time, shuts thx down immediately)
in game menu      : esc
toggle mouse warp : a

* Mouse control
rotate view       : move mouse
control cannon    : move mouse, while holding middle button
move view         : move mouse, while holding right button
fire              : left click

* Controlling your viewpoint
move view         : d, g, r, f, t, b
rotate view       : h, k
tilt view         : u, j

The above keys are laid out as the arrow keys for your left and right
hand. Using the mouse, you should use your left hand to control your
position, and the right hand to control your orientation.  You have a
choice of controlling the cannon with your mouse or the following
keys. Use the mouse for major changes, fine tune with the keyboard.
Adjusting the force of the cannon is always done using the keyboard.

* Controlling your canon
tilt cannon       : up, down
rotate cannon     : left, right
adjust force      : +,-
change projectile : tab
fire              : space or enter

* Controlling various options
render lines      : 1
render polygons   : 2
render textures   : 3
toggle lights     : 4
toggle shade mode : 5
toggle normals    : 6
toggle markers    : 7
toggle fly mode   : 8
toggle clip mode  : 9
test refresh rate : 0 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* GOTCHAS

The program tries to keep the mouse in the window by warping the
pointer. (Disable this by pressing 'a' at any time, look under
controls below). It seems that for very fast computers the mouse
warp may break in large windows. I have no idea why, but if you do, 
please let me know.

If you get a full screen window, that does not react to your input,
you may be stuck with the mouse outside the window. This could
possible happen if another application grabs global focus, and in this
case you may no longer be able to control thx. (This happens for me,
when I use my 3dfx card, and my mail box pops a message up. In this
case, I blind switch to a virtual console, log in, and run "killall
thx", which solves my problems). This may be fixed with the warping.

* Final notes

You read this far? Amazing....
