This is a note about how to do the AI. 

Nothing conclusive, just a bunch of thoughts.


** Purpose of the AI

The purpose of the AI is to provide players with an interessting
enough opponent to actually enjoy playing the game. 


** Goals of the AI player

The goals of any AI player can be grouped and listed as below.

* Game goal

To win the game, the AI need the highest total score

* Round goal

- For any round, you wish to maximize the credit you obtain (hitting)
- If you are very agressive, you may wish to kill the others (hitting
  and doing holes, etc)
- If you like to do revenge, you may remember who killed you from the 
  previous round, and wish to kill them
- If it is clear that you are not going to be able to win the game, 
  you may wish to influence the order of the game, by trying to 
  demote someone who have annoyed you.

* Turn goal

- Performing the round goal
- Stay alive (protect yourself)
- Revenge
- Hit someone
- Kill someone by hitting or other action. 

** Workings of the AI player

Depending on IA personality, the goals can be weighted
differently. The actual doings of the AI should reflect these goals.

At the start of the game, the goal is to win the game.  At the start
of each round, a decision about the current rounds goal is taken. At
the start of each turn, this decision is reevaluated, where the
current decision weights a lot. Also at the start of each turn, the
current turn goal is decided with the turn goal in mind, and carried
out.

Depending on cleverness, the AI player may adjust angles, cannon,
etc. very finely or very coarse. A clever AI may take into
consideration wind, etc. Feedback is given from the projectile,
explosions, and other players.
