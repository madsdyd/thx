  - Tracked down a bug in the texture_load code

20000618

20000609
  - Added menu for buying stuff between rounds

20000608

  - Changed the Within method of the map, which I hope will fix the issues with 
    projectiles exploding at the wrong place/time.

    at run time. 

20000605

  - Removed a lot of cout statements
  - Made an money award system.

20000604

20000530
  - added menugame and client files trying to clean up a bit

20000528

  - Added light
  - Added options to control light, shademode, normals from keyboard
  - Change the projectile module to use a more modular update
  - Added a fed extra projectiles - currently non-selectable
  - Updated the game/round/turn code - still not done, but better:
    Player change is now correct AFAIK.
    Round end is now correctly determined (but not handled). 
    Dying animation needs to insert "affect_round" until they are done.

20000521
  - Added support for map size from menu.

20000510
  - Changed glTexFont to allow interspace adjustments to the char rendering, 
    which gives sligthly nicer looking displays.
  - Introduced storage values to the menu system, that for now can be used to 
    start a game with a given number of players.

20000508
  - Changed the menu system to look a little nicer.
  - Made the menu rendering dependent on the screen size.
  - Added menu help text

20000507
  - Made the exit and start menu entries do something.

20000506
  - The menu system uses glTexFont code to render the menu with.
  - Added color module
  - Added "text" module as wrapper to glTexFont.
  - Made TListMenuItem class.
  - Made TInfoMenuItem that still needs quite some work.

20000504
  - started to use glTexFont library. Some changes will be needed, but
    in general I think it is great for this project. It has problems
    with proportional writings. Maybe I should fix this?

20000427
  - fixed a wrapping in menus.
  - made menu entries be able to be disabled.

20000426
  - Have some menuitems in place. (Value, String, Sub, Return).

20000424
  - made the impact on maps use the radius and be "round" in nature.
  - made menu skeleton, still needs a lot of work.

20000423
  - converted map to c++ class.
  
20000422
  - made projectile spawn marker entities
  - made fixed updates of the game state when deltatime > max_deltatime
    this helps make the physics more accurate.
  - updated todo file

20000421
  - tank, projectile and explosion is now converted to c++
  - game, entities mostly OK now, cleaned up.
  - player now converted.
  - more then 2 players can now be added to the game.
  - players that are dead are now removed from the game.
  - can change between rendering types on 1, 2, 3 on the keyboard.

20000420
  - converted game.hh and entities.hh to c++. Still some old code in there.

20000419
  - new function for common entities
  - function pointers to entities render functions

20000418
  - new module "textures" added. Textures are now working. I think.
  - can now use textures of different sizes
  - cleaned up display a little

20000417
  - tanks take damage both from explosions and faling to the ground
  - tanks use a vector_t for location, and is drawn at their z values
  - tanks have a cannon that can rotate, keys on [,] [.] (is drawed)
  - projectiles are fired from the location of the tank
  - tank code pretty much cleaned up.
  - adjusted near clip plane. Makes most of the errors with z buffer go away.

20000416
  - As a test, made the projectile spawn "kids" upon first explosion. :-)
    This is a hack now, but demonstrates the flexibility of the entity system.
  - Corrected bug in mappoint_at macro/function
  - Landscape now takes (simple) damage  
  - Cleaned up the map module. Mostly ok now.

20000415
  - Updated entities to use a "update_func" pointer.
  - Added function to map that checks if a location is within the map.
  - Projectiles that leaves the map now explodes.
  - Changed bitmap font in display c. Removed a bit of old code.
  - Updated the tank module, and it is now almost as it should be.
  - Projectiles can now be fired from within game.c and is fired with correct values.

20000413
  - Fixed most of the problems with inserting/removing entities

20000412
  - Updated the cvs. Underway to the next version.
  - Entity system almost in place now. Entities can be added and removed
    quite dynamically.
  - Found the "refreshrate" bug: adding lines to print was the reason that 
    the performance fell so violently.

20000410
  - reorganized quite a bit. Is now using glutIdle to update the game
    world. This works with a "new_projectile_t" and using entities to 
    automatically update the world. Still undecided as to what to do with 
    the update/render issue and client/server stuff. Eventually I may 
    decide to move all handling of an entity (map, tank, projectile, etc)
    into the various modules that handles these, and make conditional defines
    in the case with the dedicated server. The display stuff is now handled
    (skeleton in place, works with new_projectile) by using the games 
    dynamic list of entities.

20000408
  - moved data stuff into a data directory, source into src

20000407
  - made landscape height floating point
  - now uses lists to display terrain - improved performance approx 30 %.
  
20000405
  - fixed texture repeate bug. It was a braindamaged thing.
  - now has a sligthly better landscape slide model

20000404:
  - better movement code (new keybindings)
  - textures mapped linearly
  - added refreshrate function
  - limited viewpoint to 3 within map
  - random tank placement minimum 5 from border and not on line
  - added backside culling - minimal speed up. (bugs?)
  - added some more keys to rotate up and down and a flymode
  - fixed initial impact bug

20000403:
  - First version
  - 11 hours of coding
  - texture mapped landscape
  - single type of balistic missile
  - 2 degrees of freedom
  - broken collision detect with ground
  - single map
  - texture mapping based on landheight
  - sound on impact (non portable)
