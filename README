This program has only been tested under Linux. You need support for OpenGL 
(MesaGL) and probably some sort of hardware support to run this program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* COMPILING

To compile:
$cd src && make && cd ..

You may have to fix some includes and stuff, especially for
<GL/*>. Some compilers seems to be more strict about implict type
conversions than others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* RUNNING

To run:
$./thx

If you get a coredump, there are 3 very likely causes: 
- you do not have rigths to access your 3d hardware. 
 (You may be running as non-root/with restrictive permissions).
- you are running as root, but have not setup your display correctly.
- you found a bug! (Please report this)

If you have OSS sound, there should be some sound effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* GOTCHAS

The program does not grab the mouse - make sure that you do not move
the mouse outside the window you start the program in, or you may
loose control.
